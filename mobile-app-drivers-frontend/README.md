# Mobile App for Drivers - Frontend

This repository holds all the frontend code for the OXO Driver's app. 

## Development

Every change that is needed to the code should be documented in an issue, if you see something wrong in the code or the UI that you can't tend to right then, open an issue with a description of what is wrong, and where to find the code. 

### Opening an issue 

When you open an issue, describe what the issue is, and if necesary, what steps are needed to replicate it. 

If the issue is a new feature, include as many details as possible about what this feature is. 

Add labels to your issue to show its priority and other attributes, the labels are:

1. feature (use this for a new feature or requested feature)
2. bug (something is wrong, let's fix it)
3. priotities (0-2, 0 means all other work stops and whoever can needs to fix that issue, 2 means its a nice thing to have)
  - almost all issues will be priority 1 or 2.
  
If there is someone you know who is already working on something related to this issue, you can assign it to them, but ask people before assigning them too much work!

### Pull Requests

Pull requests keep the code organized. Once you have made changes, open a pull request with them against the `dev` branch. 

A reviewer is required in order to merge your pull request. If you know someone already understands your code, request them as a reviewer. 

If changes are requested make a commit into that same branch and comment to let the reviewer know to come check it out again!
